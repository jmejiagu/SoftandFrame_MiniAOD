Run: (use your favorite input sample. You will see examples in the confi files).

There are several examples here. let's try to explain some of them.

JPsiTrk.cc
This is to reconstruct Jpsi+Trk.
In the configuration file, you will set the B-mass window and the Track-mass.
For example, in the config file "PsikaonRootupler.py" You will see it is for "B+->JpsiK" decay channel. 
It, clearly, is easy to move to "Bc->Jpsipi"

JPsiTrkTrk.cc
This is to reconstruct Jpsi+2Trk.
In the configuration file, you will set the B-mass window and the Track-mass for both tracks.
For example, in the config file "PsiphiRootupler.py" ("Psiphi_MC_Rootupler.py") You will see it is for "Bs->Jpsiphi" decay channel. 
While the config file "Psitrktrk_Rootupler.py" is for "psi(2S)>Jpsipipi" and, with the appropriate mass window, you could see "X(3872)>Jpsipipi", too.

JPsiV0.cc
This is to reconstruct Jpsi+V0.
"V0" means for long live particles, Ks0 or  Lambda.
In the configuration file, you will set the B-mass window and the Track-mass for both tracks.
For example, in the config file "PsiV0_Bd_Rootupler.py" You will see it is for "Bd->JpsiKs0" decay channel, where Ks0 decays as Ks0->pipi. 
It, clearly, is easy to move to "/\b->Jpsi/\".

chicRootupler.cc and chibRootupler.cc
Those are to reconstruct Jpsi+Gamma and Upsilon+Gamma, respectively.
The associated configuration files are: run-chic-miniaod.py and run-chib-miniaod.py.
